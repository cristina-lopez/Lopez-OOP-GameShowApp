# Lopez-OOP-GameShowApp
 Project for Unit 4 of FSJS Techdegree.

 This project displays one of five random phrases on the screen 
 after the user presses "Start Game". The user can then click on 
 buttons on the screen to attempt to guess the phrase. If the 
 letter pressed is in the phrase, the letter shows up. If the letter 
 is not in the phrase, the user loses a life. If the user finds all 
 of the letters in the phrase, they are taken to a "you win" screen. If 
 the user loses all of their lives, they are taken to a "you lose" screen.
 The user can then reset the game board and start over.
